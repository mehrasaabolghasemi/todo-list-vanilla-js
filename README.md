# 📝 To‑Do List (Vanilla JavaScript)

A clean and responsive **To‑Do List App** built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This small project helped me practice DOM manipulation and basic CRUD logic without using any frameworks.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Add new tasks  
- Edit tasks directly in the list (toggle between “Edit” / “Save”)  
- Delete tasks instantly  
- Responsive layout that works on all screens

---

## 🎨 Design
The UI uses a dark theme with **pink‑purple gradients** and **CSS variables** for easy theme control.  
I focused on simplicity and balance — everything styled manually using Flexbox, transitions, and subtle effects.

---

## 💡 Tech
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (variables, gradients, flexbox)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events)

---

## 🚧 Limitation
Tasks don’t stay after refresh yet — I’ll add **Local Storage** in the next update.
